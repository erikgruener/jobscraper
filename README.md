# Job Scraper   

![](https://github.com/erikgruener/jobscraper/workflows/Unittest/badge.svg)

Tired of clicking through pages and not being able to apply filters. Me too. So here some code to scrape indeed.com jobs and create a csv for you to sort as you wish.  

## Requirements  

```bash
pip install lxml beatifulsoup4 requests
```

## Usage  

change the values in the main function (Jobtitle, location, nogo-firms..)

```bash
python indeed_scrape.py
```
